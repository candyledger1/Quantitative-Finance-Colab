# Computational Finance — Automated Trading Strategies

This repository contains the work for the **“B404B Computational Finance”** course at the **University of Tübingen**.  
Our project focuses on developing, implementing, and evaluating **algorithmic trading strategies** based on historical stock data using **Python and NumPy**.  
The final submission date for this project was **June 29, 2025**.

The project uses historical stock price data (closing prices and returns) from **Yahoo Finance**.  
All data is automatically downloaded and cleaned within the notebooks.  
The datasets serve as the foundation for testing and evaluating the trading strategies.

## Definition of Trading Signals

We developed and analyzed **three distinct trading signals**, each representing a different market perspective:

### **Signal 1 – Momentum Crossover**
A combination of **short-term and long-term moving averages** to identify momentum shifts in price trends.

### **Signal 2 – Mean Reversion (RSI-Based)**
Uses the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** to detect overbought and oversold conditions, triggering contrarian trades.

### **Signal 3 – Volatility Breakout**
Implements a **dynamic volatility channel** that generates buy/sell signals when price movements exceed statistical thresholds.

Each signal was parameterized, tested, and calibrated using in-sample data, then validated on out-of-sample periods.

## Computation of Signals and Portfolio Positions

- Signals are computed using **pure NumPy** functions (no rolling or built-in smoothing from Pandas).  
- The computed signals define **stock positions** (+1 for long, 0 for neutral, –1 for short).  
- The resulting time series of positions is combined with returns to generate **strategy returns**.  
- All reusable functions (returns, volatility, signal generation, evaluation) are stored in **`module.py`** for cleaner structure and reproducibility.

## Statistical Analysis

The performance of each trading strategy is evaluated using several financial metrics, including:

- **Cumulative returns**  
- **Volatility and drawdowns**  
- **Sharpe ratio**  
- **Jensen’s alpha** (for benchmark-adjusted performance)  

These statistics allow a comprehensive comparison between the individual signals and a passive benchmark strategy such as the **S&P 500**.

## Graphical Results

The notebooks visualize the strategies through:

- Price and signal overlay plots  
- Portfolio performance curves  
- Rolling Sharpe ratios and return distributions  
- Comparative charts between strategies and benchmarks  

These visualizations make it easy to interpret the effectiveness of each signal and its robustness across different market regimes.

## Additional Considerations

In the final discussion, we explore:

- The influence of **market volatility** on signal stability  
- **Transaction costs** and their impact on net returns  
- The **economic intuition** behind each strategy’s performance  
- How combining multiple signals could potentially improve diversification
